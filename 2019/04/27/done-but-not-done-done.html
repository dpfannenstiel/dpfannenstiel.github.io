    <p>My skin is warm.
My muscles … they don’t ache, but they tingle.
A low, dull throbbing resonates throughout my entire body.
And I have that heat behind my eyes.
The kind you get when you know you have a fever coming on.</p>

<p>I’m probably not sick.</p>

<p>Probably.</p>

<p>It’s become difficult to tell.
A lot of the past few months has been so “go-go-go” that it’s become hard to tell the difference between sick and tired.
I’m just tired.</p>

<p>Probably.</p>

<p>I spent all morning in the garden.
One of the many things I had been putting off for months was weeding and cleaning up the front garden.
It had begun … no, that’s false.
It had been looking bad for a while.
I there had just been too many other things to do.</p>

<p>Moving into a house is a big deal.
I’m still not “Done Done”.
But the list is smaller.
The items getting put into the backlog are manageable and understood.
There’s some success in that.</p>

<p>The mere fact that I’m worried about “Done Done” is nice.
It means that the necessary and proper is complete.
I know there’s more to do and I’ll do it, but those are things that can be pushed later.
At least a little bit.</p>

<p>I need to make a list.</p>

<p>I can spend a bit more time on the things I want.
This blog for example.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’ve had to admit that I’ve been doing too much and had to drop some stuff.
I canceled Family Meal at game.
It was just too much.</p>
