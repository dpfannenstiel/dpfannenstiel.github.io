Maybe it's because I'm deep inside the 2018 *Spider-Man* video game, but I instantly fell in love with this trailer.

Instantly.

Breaking it down, there were five major elements on display.
How big those elements end up being to the film are anyone's guess, but they do feature prominently in the trailer.
Out of my fandom for [DOB][1] and Cracked let's listicle this sucker.

## 5. Overseas Trip

Okay, the Academic Decathon team is going over seas for reasons.
Staying in hostels or what have you.
Looks like the trip of a life time for young Peter ... were he not Spider-man.
His insistence a leaving his suit, despite May's suggestion, behind might be a red herring; a trick of editing.
There's not much here, it set's the scene for us.

## 4. Nick Fury

Samuel L. Jackson is the fourth most interesting thing about this trailer.
Let that sink in for a moment.

**Fourth.**

It looks like he's recruiting Spidey for some blah, blah, blah, new suit, blah, blah, blah.

Fourth.
Most.
Intersting.
Thing.

## 3. New MJ

MJ was one of my favorite parts about *Spider-Man: Homecoming*.
I'll cover that more when I write it up before *Avengers: Endgame*, but I enjoyed watching her toy with Peter here.
It was a nice change from the portrayals we've seen of MJ in the past and I fully support it.

## 2. Happy and Aunt May

"Hot Aunt May" was a nice bit in *Civil War*.
And I was glad they carried it through to *Homecoming*.
Frankly, I'd love to see May, Tony, and Pepper in a scene together where Pepper starts getting possessive about Tony.

The Happy and May bit was just exciting.
Not merely because I like the running gag, but because I'm kind of pulling for Happy here.
He doesn't have much.

His job?
As Iron Man's body guard?
It would be nice to see him settle down.

I'm shipping these two.
Is there a petition I can sign?

## 1. Mysterio

I am not a Spider-Man fan (sorry Daniel, who totally reads this).
I don't know the first thing about the comics.

But I do know a little about movies.

They're not shooting Mysterio like a villian.
He's pretty.
He's showing his face.
He's defending the little people.
He's got broad shoulders and is fighting a monster.

He's a hero.

At least, that's how he sees it.

I remember the thing someone said about Shrek, "every villian is the hero of their own story."
That looks exactly like what they're doing to Mysterio.
Sure, it sets up a trope for "friends become enemies," but that's okay sometimes.
Given everything else they've done in the MCU, they'll probably nail it.

I guess we'll find out in July.
