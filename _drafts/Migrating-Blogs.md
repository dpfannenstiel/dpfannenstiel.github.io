After much consideration, I\'ve decided to remove my personal wordpress blog and replace it with my github pages blog.
I\'ll be keeping the old posts, just because and re-adding my old WP posts.
The process has been relatively easy.
Exporting the WP data was as simple as a button press.
Because of Reasons&trade; I've had to figure out how to use a special `versions.conf` file to support mutile versions of Ruby.
But RVM made that pretty simple. https://rvm.io/workflow/projects
Then all I had to do was change from Pygments to Rogue and everything just worked.
All in all, it was a pretty simple task.
