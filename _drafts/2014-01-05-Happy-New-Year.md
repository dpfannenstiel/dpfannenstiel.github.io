# Happy New Year!

As 2013 closed I started looking for a project for 2014.  Something to keep me occupied in my off hours.  You know, a hobby.  As I ran through the possible options they all came back to \"do something and blog about it\".

Though I was vaguely familiar WordPress and quickly installed it.  Though I don\'t have much experience with HTML or PHP, I did find plugin that supported Markdown editing.  Which was nice, as I have been using Markdown extensivly to do documentation on other projects.

Mid-way through my first blogpost I realized I didn\'t care for the way the base theme, Twentythirteen, was handling &lt;code> blocks.  I began shopping around for a better theme.  Having found none I liked, I resolved to write my own WordPress theme.  I began tinkering with WordPress, reading source code, and hacking at a solution.  I was pleased with the progess I made and had made great strides towards my principle goal: Excellent handling of &lt;code> blocks.

Speaking with a coworker, though, I was told about Github Pages and Jekyll; which have combined to form the platform you are now reading this blog on.  I will leave the installation guide to Github.  And an excellent job it does.  I do want to mention a few reasons why I\'ve chosen to concentrate on Github Pages and Jekyll as my blog host.

* **Markdown** - As I said earlier, I\'ve been using Markdown related products to add documentation to some projects I\'m currently working on.  I\'ve become very comfortable with the language

* **Free** - Github Pages are repositories on Github and, as long as you have no problem keeping your repository public, it\'s free.  You really can\'t shake a stick at that.  Some people, myself included, may balk at the idea of leaving their source code out in the open for anyone to see.  Since leaving the repository public doesn\'t affect copyright and this isn\'t code I\'m interested in trading on, I found the cost/benefit analysis supported it\'s use.

* **Local Install** - Jekyll installs nicely as a gem.  Once installed, you can launch a Jekyll server on your local machine to quickly view the site before publishing.

* **Quick Publishing** - You publish to your site by committing to the associated repository.  I literally cannot think of an easier way to publish a webpage.

## 25 To Go

This represents my first entry in a year of articles.  Most of the rest will, hopefully, be more robust, but my goal for this year is to publish 26 articles on technical subjects.  One about every two weeks.  Thanks for reading the first one and I hope you\'ll come back for more soon.
