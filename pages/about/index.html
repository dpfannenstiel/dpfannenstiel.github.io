Grimorum.io is maintained by Dustin Pfannenstiel, a software engineer specializing in native mobile applications based in Austin, Texas, in an effort to finally figure out how this whole internet fad works.

Dustin has degrees from Florida State University and George Mason University.  When away from his computers he enjoys tabletop games and the writing of Joss Whedon. If you happen to be a fan of either the *Gargoyles* animated series or the *Star Wars: Customizable Card Game* then you\'re well on your way to being fast friends.
