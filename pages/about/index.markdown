This is the incredibly nerdy blog of Dustin Pfannenstiel, social media ex-pat.

Dustin has degrees from Florida State University and George Mason University.  When away from his computers he enjoys tabletop games and the writing of Joss Whedon. If you happen to be a fan of either the *Gargoyles* animated series or the *Star Wars: Customizable Card Game* then you\'re well on your way to being fast friends.
