&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; has been out for a few weeks now to mixed reviews.  Most people I know disliked the film.  My brother is pretty ambivalent about it, which I guess I understand.  I have less understanding for the people who outright dislike it.  Adam Savage’s podcast “Still Untitled” had a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/last-jedi-spoilercast-still-untitled-adam-savage-project/id586730504?i=1000397863360&amp;amp;mt=2&quot;&gt;review of the film&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll try not repeat him too much, but I believe it was there that I did hear someone say, “&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; was always a children’s film”.  I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start with what I disliked.  First, foremost, and eternally: The Pod Racer Scene.  ”What pod racer scene?” I can hear you asking through the aether.  The Pod Racer Scene.  The pointless, cutesy chase scene in the middle of the movie because someone decided that a jail break wasn’t enough action.  It did nothing for the movie and the run time certainly didn’t need it.  The second thing was the conflict generated by the fleet only having 18 hours of fuel.  I understand the role that ticking clocks can have in generating tension in film.  This scenario just didn’t make sense.  I’m willing to forgive the question about where the rest of the Imp- First Order fleet was.  I can even explain away the inability to micro jump.  18 hours doesn’t seem nearly enough time for Finn and Rose to go find this computer guy and bring him back.  I know hyper speed is faster than warp drive, it just doesn’t seem reasonable that they could have ever expected to fulfill the mission and get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets leave the negativity behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; was a stunningly beautiful film.  In particular, having the star cruiser hyper speed through Snoke’s command ship was amazing to watch.  Rian Johnson’s decision to cut audio was inspired.  Imp- First Order crafts have never had such a sense of depth as when Finn and Rose infiltrated it.  Similarly, Snoke’s chamber provided a intimidating, alien environment that echoed the intensity of the Luke and Vader duel in the Cloud City Carbonite Chamber in &lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s writing powered the saga forward by ignoring as much of the J.J. Abrams setup as they possibly could.  Revealing Rey’s parentage to be completely unimportant was the best possible outcome, any other decision would have been seen as servicing some strange corner of the fandom (though, maybe if we didn’t spend so much time obsessing about it, the writers could just write).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution of Snoke by Kylo Ren set up the concluding film nicely while paying off two more plot points.  The first being the identity of Snoke.  Once again, not everything needs to be something else.  He didn’t need to be a previous Sith Lord.  All he had to be was evil: Mission Accomplished!  Finally, where are the Knights of Ren?  What are the Knights of Ren?  They’re just gone now.  No need to even bring them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meat space, hacker spaces like TechShop (more on that in another post) have allowed people to start businesses they wouldn’t have had any other way to get going.  Square… the mobile payment platform, that started because the founder went into a hacker space and prototyped the first unit to sell to investors.  Literally all it takes is a little elbow grease and some belief in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a number of comedians I’ve been following for ten years have separated from the comedy site they’ve been working for just as long.  Here are personal favorites that are really worth checking out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfrmm_Fey_I&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVhwbS-_SJ4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LO2bHcbyKyY&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I had to stop here, I also recommend &lt;i&gt;Obsessive Pop Culture Disorder&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CrackedTV&lt;/em&gt;, and just the entire rest of the Cracked video library.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer volume and diversity that this team of artists put out was absolutely staggering. Their most recent series, &lt;em&gt;Some News&lt;/em&gt;, deserves special recognition as one of the best satirical news shows of the year, often besting &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;.  And if you’ve never had a conversation in a coffee shop that reminds you of an &lt;em&gt;After Hours&lt;/em&gt; episode, then I don’t know how you’ve wasted your life this badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since their exit though, I’ve been inspired every day watching these guys.    &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drmistercody&quot;&gt;Cody Johnson&lt;/a&gt; continues to comment on politics of the day, building a voice as an articulate and seemingly non-partisan member of the resistance.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dob_inc&quot;&gt;Daniel O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; set up a night of comedy with the Cracked alumni and is among the most positive people to ever live.  A dinner between Daniel O’Brien and Lin-Manuel Miranda would end with them splitting the check by paying for each other’s meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swaim_corp&quot;&gt;Michael Swaim&lt;/a&gt; has been the breakout story this month.  I’m not going to try to tell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/why-i-left-by-15727831&quot;&gt;his story&lt;/a&gt; and it is absolutely worth listening to.  In the past month he’s build a Patreon community called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swaim_corp&quot;&gt;Small Beans&lt;/a&gt; producing podcasts with pledges in excess of $4,000 a month, of which I am a proud contributor.  It’s been an absolute joy watching this come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother is the funniest person I know.  Among our friends and family he’s the funniest person any of us know.  You are probably unaware of it, but &lt;em&gt;JFK&lt;/em&gt; - Oliver Stone’s film about the Kennedy assassination conspiracy - is a comedy.  And it’s pure gold beginning to end.  My brother should be famous.  And were he to get on social media he could be doing great things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, it’s time for me to get back into the App Development game and put out some independent stuff.  Not even stuff for other people.  If I’m the only customer that’s fine.  Makers should be their first customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be Adam Savage to be a maker.  All you have to do is sit down and make something.  Experience the joy of building something from scratch that didn’t exist before.  You don’t have to be perfect.  Try.  Fail.  Try again.  There’s a warm feeling of fulfillment that comes with making something, even if that something is a blog post you don’t actually believe anyone will read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing, in addition to the comedians linked above check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncheese&quot;&gt;John Cheese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kawillert&quot;&gt;Katie Willert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/why-i-left-by-15727831&quot;&gt;Katy Stoll&lt;/a&gt;.  They’re also wonderful Cracked alumni who are worth following and I look forward to seeing what comes next.  I don’t know any of these guys, but, through their work, I’ve had breakfast with them every day for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Darkest Hour&lt;/h3&gt;
I both enjoyed watching and didn't understand why &lt;em&gt;Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt;, the story of Winston Churchill's ascension to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the first few weeks in the position, was made in the first place.  I can ignore the historical inaccuracies and enjoy Gary Oldman's performance with ease.  Similarly, the cinematography and set design were superb.  Throughout the film the audience gets dragged through the scenery with such vigor I think there may still be a bit of muck from the streets in my shoes.

Thereafter, I run out of positive things to say.  The narrative is loosely held together by Churchill as a character, but never clearly coalesces.  Early on Lily James is introduces as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's secretary, and enters into a character arc from intimidated girl to surrogate daughter.  The transformation ends up being emotionally underwhelming.  Briefly, there is some hope that concerns of infidelity will drive the plot when Kristen Scott Thomas presents a toast to Churchill that is astoundingly chilly, but that was not to be.  The relationship with King George VI, similarly warms without a clear understanding as to why.

Ultimately, it may be that &lt;em&gt;Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt; exists because some producer wanted to see Gary Oldman recite Churchill's &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech.  Which was wonderful to watch, however it will unlikely be enough to net any prizes, including one for Oldman.
&lt;h3&gt;Get Out&lt;/h3&gt;
Conversely, &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; was a wonderfully crafted narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Throughout the entire film Jordan Peele's introduced characters and situations causing the audience to question what exactly was in store for both Daniel Kaluuya's Chris Washington and themselves.  In particular, a brief encounter with Stephen Root sets up several options for concluding the story that eventually resolve in the third act.  Allison Williams steps into the role of Rose easily and provides just enough of a peek through the veneer of sanity to keep the character believable.

In the wake of it's release and critical success a large corpus of work discussing the films portray of the African-American experience has been produced.  Speaking intelligently on this matter is beyond my qualifications and the reader is encouraged to seek out more competent reviewers.

All in all, &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; was an unexpected delight to view.  Given the challenging year in the Drama category, &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; stands a good chance of wining the Musical or Comedy field, despite it being neither.  It's chief rival will be &lt;em&gt;The Disaster Artist&lt;/em&gt;.  Finally, it's a tragedy that Jordan Peele was not nominated for Best Screenplay
&lt;h3&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/h3&gt;
Guillermo del Toro's &quot;not an Abe Sapien origin story&quot; was the most beautiful film I've seen in quite some time.  The set design was a breathtaking marriage of 50's cinema, art deco, and fantasy.  Utterly captivating.  The cinematography had realism that reminded me of the indie films of the 90's that I found easy to be lost in.

Despite not having a single line Doug Jones gave an emotional performance which perfectly mirrored Sally Hawkins as a mute custodian.  Supported by Michael Shannon, the eternal G Man, &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps the most balanced film of the year.  Part comedy, part romance, part thriller, it was a movie that any adult could walk into and find something to love.

Having not seen any of the other nominees for Best Actress, I can't gauge Sally Hawkins chances, but I also can't imagine another nominee bringing such emotional breadth to the role.  Up against &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; it's unlikely that del Toro will walk away with a Best Director or Drama award, but has a good chance of taking Screenplay as consolation prize.
&lt;h3&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt; was the best film I saw all year.  After exiting &lt;em&gt;Antman&lt;/em&gt;, Edgar Wright wrote and directed as engaging and thrilling a heist film as I've ever seen.  The characters, the music, the action, the dialogue come together perfectly building a heart pounding film that even the romance scenes supported.  A single nomination of Ansel Elgort for his role as the eponymous hero was positively criminal.  In my books this film should have been nominated for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Golden Globes are tonight, let's try to predict the future.

&lt;p&gt;Reasonable people are able to discuss taxes and the role of government in a civil manner.  National security was effectively guaranteed by the large oceans on either coast, providing a degree of freedom in other &lt;em&gt;realpolitik&lt;/em&gt; applications of international affairs.  These policies accounted for the bulwark of Republican policy since the administration of Teddy Roosevelt.  However, following the election of his cousin Franklin, the GOP only controlled Congress for 4 years cumulatively heading into the election of 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980 Ronald Reagan became the fourth President of the United States to unseat an incumbent in the 20th century.  There were a number of issues working in Reagan’s favor: The Iran Hostage Crisis, intermittently energy crises, and economic stagnation being a few.  Critically though, Reagan championed two key concepts for the Republican cause that may still be familiar: Supply Side Economics and the Evangelical Right.  Reagan’s courtship of the Evangelicals represented the final migration of the former southern Democrats into the Republican caucus following President Johnson’s signing of the 1964 Voting Rights Act, wherein he prophesied that the Democratic party would lose the South for a generation.  Effectively the Democratic and Republican parties has switched polarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party entrenched themselves in the Christian Right and the South at large by beginning to champion two specific policies.  The first was support of a strict constructionist interpretation of the Second Amendment, firearm ownership without limit.  The second being a strict opposition to abortion.  The constitutional and moral arguments for these policies were far less important than the overwhelming concern for these two tentpole issues among southern voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Republican party would continue to present low taxes, small government, and national security as the public face of Republican policy, these goals often took a back seat to abortion rights and gun control. Reagan first lowered taxes and then raising them amid recession to be reelected in 1984 by the largest electoral college victory since Washington.  From 1981 until 2018, the GOP would control the Senate and House for 18 of 36 years.  The critical observation, however is that since the Congressional redistricting in 1992 the House of Representatives has been Republican for 18 of 24 years.  Additionally, as of 2018, thirty two state legislatures are Republican controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamentalist constituencies represented by the pro-life and pro-gun lobbies can be swayed by any perceived threat to their position.  Most recently in the Alabama Senate special election, Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated an accused child molester.  Despite believing the accusations against Senator Jones’ opponent a significant portion of the electorate continued to opposed Jones because of his position on abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reliability of voters to show up can easily be illustrated by the state of Texas.  Not only do Democrats in Texas show up in larger numbers during Presidential elections, they also show up in a larger percentage.  If every Texan who voted for Hillary Clinton were to vote in 2018, not only would Texas be controlled by a Democrat during redistricting in 2020, but I would no longer have to look at Ted Cruz’s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Someone explain to me why the governor of Texas is a Republican.&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3,528,633 (43.63%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart person once said that “decisions are made by those who show up”.  Year after year the fundamentalist base of the Republican party shows up to support their two issues.  Democrats are less likely to participate in elections on off cycle years.  At the end of the day Donald Trump is President because too many voters who were opposed to Donald Trump stayed home on election day.  They were too certain that he would lose.  Next time there’s an election, please show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t vote for Jill Stein.  I’m looking at you Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trump Chooses To Not Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most likely event is that Donald Trump chooses to not run for reelection.  By all accounts he doesn’t want to be President, he never wanted it, and, most importantly, he doesn’t enjoy it.  Running for President is an exercise in branding, an endeavor that President Trump has shown a unique ability.  Beyond that the President has little interest in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see President Trump announcing that he doesn’t appreciate the way he’s been treated and attempt to bow out prior to the primaries.  It wouldn’t be completely unsurprising, out of malice or incompetence, to withdraw from the race after the filing deadlines had passed which would result in a brokered national convention for the Republican party.  This would allow party elders to select a more stable, controllable candidate and mitigate any fatigue voters may have with the current administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The GOP Supports Trump As Nominee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, GOP support for the President isn’t certain, but it is likely.  In this scenario the party leaders have to attempt to manage the Congressional  candidates in an effort to minimize the a strong anti-Trump push from the President’s opponents.  Given Orrin Hatch’s recent decision to retire from the Senate it’s entirely possible that Mitt Romney will emerge as the leader of the mainstream GOP with a concentration on traditional fiscal conservatism to defend the Legislative branch while expecting to lose the Executive branch.  Much in the same way Paul Ryan told congressional candidates to worry about their own races late in the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trump Loses the Nomination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of incumbency is strong, but it’s entirely possible that the President may lose to a primary challenger.  A traditional, mainstream Republican may end up with the nomination leaving the President out in the cold.  From this point there are two possibilities, the preferable one being that President Trump chooses to go gently into that good night.  Thereby sparing a nation desperate to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the President may again harness the forces of chaos and attempt to run as an independent.  While, again, the power of incumbency is strong, the key to victory as an independent will be organization, never a strong suit for the Trump White House.  Getting on the ballot in every state as an independent is difficult without a party to support you.  It’s entirely possible that the President gets on the ballot in a majority of states, but splitting the right wing vote with the GOP backed candidate results in a sweeping Democratic victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The GOP Rebels Against Trump As Nominee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nightmare scenario for the Democratic party is that the President wins nomination, but a moderate group from within the GOP elects to run a third party candidate.  While they will not have incumbency to aid their effort, as long term party members with experience organizing across the nation it’s very possible that they could leverage disapproval with the President to get a candidate on the ballots of a vast majority of states (I could easily see anyone to the left of the President being too liberal for Arizona or Alabama).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation the strength of the Democratic candidate becomes critical.  Moderate Republicans and independents may remain unwilling to vote for a Democratic candidate given another viable option, not merely a protest vote.  Combine that with a potential “Jill Stein Wins 10,000 Votes In Michigan” situation, now the race is a toss up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should any candidate fail to receive the required 270 electoral college votes, the election will go to the House of Representatives voting by State, not member.  Even if they GOP does not control a majority of the House, due to large populations in California, New York, and Florida, it’s entirely possible that they would control a majority of state delegations.  Remember that as of the time of publication 32 state houses are controlled by the GOP.  Given the choice between a generic Democrat or Donald Trump, it is uncertain if enough GOP state delegations defect to vote a Democrat into the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trump Is Unavailable to Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the possibility, however unlikely that Donald Trump is unavailable to run due to changes in his health or legal status.  In this case a full Republican Primary is run.  Hopefully with more predictable, sane results.&lt;/p&gt;

It's important to maintain respect for the office.  That's what I keep telling myself.

Promethean is a fun game and very different within the Chronicles of Darkness series.  It's the only one that can have a happy ending.  The player characters are artificial life forms in the style of Frankenstein's monster.  They're created from dead, or never living, matter and, through &quot;the divine fire&quot;, made life.  From that point they're on a quest to become mortal.

It allows for a really simple and immersive experience.  The characters, over the course of the chronicle, they need to learn what it is to be human.  It's the simple things like making a friend or creating original art.  Things we take for granted.  It's really wonderful, they're a blank slate.

Part of that blank slate is that they usually come into the world in horrible ways.  For another story I had created a character that was a Promethean to wage war against the owners of the plantation he was created on; from pieces of deceased slaves.

As I run the game I'm slowly incorporating elements of the world so that the players and I don't have to immediately understand the entirety of the world.  Since this is also a horror game, I decided to write up part of the biography for that old character, called his &quot;ramble&quot;, and presented it to the characters.  Enjoy.
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;I remember not just the beginning. But before the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;I remember the man lashing my own kin to the tree and unfurling the whip. I remember thunder erupting from his hand. Over and over and over. My kin was strong from a life time of hunting in his homeland. And the rope was poorly tied. He might have broken free, but not for the creature. The creature held the rope tight as my kin suffered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;When next my kin was tied to the tree it was by the neck and the creature held his feet. The creature quieted the screams of my kin as they were ravaged. My kin were but babes, torn from the breast of their mothers. Skulls smashed against the stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;I saw it all. And for all of it the creature was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Before my eyes, one became ten became a hundred became a thousand. They died screaming. For all of it the creature was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;And then it became my turn. The thunder exploded around me. Through me. Again and again. And my eyes opened and I saw her. A tiny little woman, looking of my kin, with her hand raised. I couldn't breath and she saw me panic. She stayed her hand and two of my kin rushed over and cut me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;And that was how I began.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I've volunteered to run a Promethean game for my RPG group.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Three Johns</title><link href="https://dpfannenstiel.github.io/2018/01/02/the-three-johns.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Three Johns" /><published>2018-01-02T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-01-02T13:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://dpfannenstiel.github.io/2018/01/02/the-three-johns</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dpfannenstiel.github.io/2018/01/02/the-three-johns.html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s my idea for a movie.  Anyone willing to make this movie can have the idea for free.  Just get it done.  It’s called &lt;em&gt;The Three Johns&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about a guy named John who owns a hardware store in small town USA.  He’s good guy, the sort of master craftsman who you can bring in a stripped screw or damaged hinge and he can pick out the exact replacement from the massive wall of drawers and nooks behind him instantly on seeing your part.  He’s a good family man, active in the church, the whole nine yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to his friends and family he’s also involved in some criminal enterprise.  For the purpose of this post he’s running a prostitution ring out of the truck stop.  But it could just as easily be drugs or dog fighting or importing Kinder eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the hook: You cast the Johns Cusack, Goodman, and Turturro to play him.  You shoot each scene three times, swapping out only the John.  Then when you edit the film together you show each scene three times, once by each John.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you give the Johns pieces of their script out of order.  So, let’s say there are 4 parts to this whole thing:  The hardware shop, the church, the house, and the truck stop.  You start Cusack off at the church.  Serving as a deacon reading scripture, sitting on the board going over financials, teaching Sunday school.  Just give him the scenes where John is very in control as an upstanding, if stuffy, member of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the first thing Goodman sees is the scripts for the hardware store.  People hanging out in there.  The high school football player who works there comes in a bit late and get’s needled a little for it.  An indigent person comes in asking if he’s hiring.  Set him up to play John as a very friendly, outgoing, hands on sort of guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Turturro first gets him at the truck stop.  He’s running his business, which is problematic because the new girl just doesn’t understand how to act.  He get’s violent with her.  It’s just a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inverting those first two actors in the scenes now, after already having played one version of the character, forces them to play the new scenes differently.  Maybe John’s needling of the football player now comes off as disapproval.  Mean while, at the church, John does well talking to people, but having to get up in front of the congregation makes it obvious he’s not cut out for public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they go home.  And his daughter’s friend Cassie want’s fuck all to do with him.  His daughter thinks everything is cool, but Cassie is made uncomfortable by his very presence.  See, Cassie has a new job starting tonight working as a waitress down at the truck stop.  And she’s pretty nervous about it, so John tries to help her calm down and talk to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing here is key.  It needs to sound real for each variant of The John.  ”Look, these are just hard working guys stopping in for a piece of pie.  Give ‘em a smile, chat ‘em up a little.  And it’ll all be over before you know it.  You might even enjoy it.”  A perfectly reasonable piece of fatherly advice that becomes spine chillingly evil in the wrong context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of those actors play significantly different characters in their careers.  I just think it would be interesting to see how their acting choices change the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

From everything I've heard John Turturro is a wonderful man, he's just a little typecast.

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be spending the last day of my holiday cleaning the house and generally avoiding the freezing temperatures outside.  As I write this, the sun is shining and it’s all of 24 degrees outside.  I don’t know how I’ll get my steps in today, but it’s easy to imagine that it will be cold and miserable as I do so. At least it’s 2018!  Happy New Year’s y’all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest I don’t recall if it should be “Happy New Year” or “Happy New Year’s”, as in “Happy New Year’s Day”.  It’s definitely not plural as in “Happy New Years” or a contraction for “Happy New Years Day”.  Strunk and White, in &lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that consistency is more important than strict adherence to the rules of rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was kind of a weird paragraph, wasn’t it?  As though it were the paragraph of an eighth grade english student trying, desperately, to pad out the length of a homework assignment they don’t want to be doing.  Funny you should mention that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My New Year’s Resolution is to publish five hundred words a day on this blog.  I’ve had it for quite a while and am finally doing something with it.  Back in the heady days of MySpace I use to publish quite often.  Perhaps not a mandated length each day, but I did write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, over the past few years, I feel like I’ve lost a step.  I read less. I write less.  I complete fewer personal projects.  Even my capabilities as a conversationalist have declined significantly.  It’s a terrible feeling and I want to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened around the same time that may have contributed to it.  A bit may have been social media.  A bit may have been owning an iPad, having the internet in your hand instead of a book might not be a good thing.  Part of it was likely just the daily grind of commuting and career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my attempt to get back into fighting weight; to be a more thoughtful, considerate person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t decided what it’s going to be about.  Perhaps it’ll be my thoughts on topics of the day.  Maybe a vignette that peers into an event from my day.  Reviews of film, television, and books will probably fill out more than a few column inches.  Short fiction… yes I have some of that in the can that I may subject you to.  I will endeavor to avoid whining and “diary entries”, just as a public service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect anyone to read every entry, waiting each day for my next publication.  But if you decide to drop by, there will be something new for you each day.  Thanks for dropping in and, again, be well.&lt;/p&gt;

Keurig coffee tastes terrible and I’m just not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased my current coffee maker several months after moving into my apartment, having finally grown tired of doing pour over coffee. All I was after was a small pot, it’s just me here I don’t need much.  I also really wanted to get one of those insulated pots.  That was my “nice to have” feature.  And I didn’t want to spend a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually found a Mr. Coffee maker that had the steel pot I thought I was looking for.  Upon opening it I was immediately disappointed as the pot was merely steel and not insulated.  Having failed for quite a few weeks to successfully find a coffee pot that fit my requirements I accepted the failure and moved on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coffee pot, it turns out, is pretty gosh darn terrible.  The heating element turns off after about half an hour (I’ve never bothered to time it).  Additionally, I’ve had to get into the habit of pouring the coffee over the sink because no matter the angle of the spout coffee runs down the side of the pot spilling everywhere.  My mom’s coffee pot has the exact same problem.  You’d think this would be one of the key requirements of the pot itself: Don’t spill.  And yet…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my quest for a coffee maker I was astounded at the price of them.  Years of shopping at Target have conditioned me to not purchase any kitchen appliance over $50.  And it’s not like my parents had to do this all that much either.  They still use a waffle maker from 1982 that still works.  Their plastic spatula, which they’ve owned longer than I have been alive, didn’t die until someone mistook it for a high temperature silicone and tried to scramble eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t want to talk about who that was, I don’t see the point in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their pans.  Oh my God.  Their pots and pans were gifted to them for their wedding.  I am literally unable to fathom how they are still in service and make such good food.  These days if you go and try to buy a 12 inch pan you’re going to be inundated with features: non stick surface, 1/8th inch steel plate, copper, oven safe, pre-seasoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad has one 12 inch stainless steel pan that he will use for everything and it will come out better than anything I can cook.  Hot dogs?  The Pan.  Steak? The Pan.  Grilled cheese?  The Pan.  I can’t cook more than three pieces of bacon simultaneously.  My dad will perfectly cook bacon, hash browns, and three styles of eggs in the morning using nothing but The Pan and a single fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time I’m spending hours traveling from store to store, inspecting each coffee maker in excruciating detail and hoping I can get out of this ordeal before February and for under $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I can’t afford a house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reason I am willing to pay for it is they’re doing a Jack Ryan TV series starting next year.  I’ve been Jack Ryan fan since I was in the sixth grade.   Even though Jack Ryan on screen has been somewhat hit or miss, I’m really looking forward to it.  Ahead of that, I thought I’d express some thoughts on the film series so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hunt for Red October&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 10/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold standard for Jack Ryan movies.  The casting was perfect.  From Alec Baldwin to Sean Connery to &lt;del&gt;Glenn Scott&lt;/del&gt; Scott Glenn to Fred Thompson to &lt;span class=&quot;itemprop&quot;&gt;Courtney B. Vance.  More than James Bond - you know what.  I’m going to hold my thoughts and give this one a whole post later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Point: Sean Connery’s Marko Ramius was absolutely amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: Alec Baldwin’s only outing as Jack Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patriot Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 6/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Ryan’s sophomore film outing was thoroughly forgettable.  Despite picking up Harrison Ford and then pairing him with Samuel L. Jackson &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; practically starting the “Sean Bean dies” trope this movie misfired on all cylinders.  Ford played Jack Ryan competently as an “every man” but changes to the story to make it fit in the continuity of &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hunt For Red October&lt;/i&gt; were almost jarring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Point: Harrison Ford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: Sean Bean dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clear And Present Danger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patriot Games&lt;/em&gt; did so well that Harrison Ford almost didn’t come back.  Ultimately, I’m glad he did.  &lt;em&gt;Clear And Present Danger&lt;/em&gt; did a wonderful job of setting up Felix Cortez (wonderfully played by &lt;span class=&quot;itemprop&quot;&gt;Joaquim de Almeida) as a mirror to Jack Ryan.  The juxtaposition of Ryan and Cortez throughout the film was a little ham fisted, at one point even referring to Cortez as a “latin Jack Ryan”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The injection of Willem Dafoe to the series, however, was masterful.  Dafoe plays John Clark with a degree of steely madness that only he could harness.  Moving between cover operations and field operations John Clark had more depth than any other character in the film.  Though, Ding really jumped off the page as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Point: Willem Dafoe and Raymond Cruz will be John Clark and Domingo Chavez in my mind’s eye until the day I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: Dan Murray dies.  Also this article may contain spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sum Of All Fears&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 4/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of the fucking end.  I don’t mind Ben Affleck as Ryan.  I liked that they were trying to get back to a younger Jack Ryan and re-boot the series.  However they turned Jack Ryan into an action hero.  Jack Ryan isn’t an action hero.  He’s a guy who laments not putting things in a “god damned memo”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a weak film, it did $192 million on a $68 million budget (yes, I’m using Wikipedia for help on this blog).  So now, Hollywood has learned a lesson.  Take any beloved franchise and turn it into an action genre with huge explosions and it’ll be a massive success.  Here’s a brief list of things that have been ruined because of this film’s success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;MacGyver&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Star Trek&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Transformers&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The Mummy&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;G.I. Joe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Point: Liev Schreiber as John Clark.  I was really hoping he’s also get the &lt;em&gt;Without Remorse&lt;/em&gt; film as well, but that seems to have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: I honestly forgot about this movie when I was first compiling this list.  I feel really bad about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 4/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reboot of the Jack Ryan series doesn’t fare much differently than &lt;i&gt;The Sum of All Fears&lt;/i&gt;.  Again we have a young Jack Ryan, this time played by Chris Pine.  Chris Pine can play the everyman.  I’ve seen him do it (&lt;em&gt;Hell or High Water&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderful film that you should see, but will not enjoy).  But again, Jack Ryan is an action hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is beautifully shot.  There’s a sense of depth throughout the movie that just didn’t exist in previous films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Point: Kenneth Branagh as the villain and director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: The plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Air Force One (Honorable Mention)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin’s Score: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into detail since it’s, technically, not a Jack Ryan film, but there’s absolutely no reason it couldn’t have been.  Just throwing that out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Point: Gary Oldman swearing in Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Point: Not technically a Jack Ryan film.&lt;/p&gt;
